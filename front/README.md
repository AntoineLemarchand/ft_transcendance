# react-transcendance

## Description
The aim of the react app is to deploy a responsive website linked to the
rest application.

## Tech stack
This is the typescript version of react.
The styling is helped by [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
and simplified with [sass/scss](https://sass-lang.com)

## design
As right now, no one on the project is keen on design,
the main idea will be to use as much gruvbox as possible.

Each page will be composed of two to three components on larger enough monitors:
| profile | main part | chat |
| ------- | --------- | ---- |

On phone, anything will be accessible from the navbar.
